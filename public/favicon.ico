The file /my-nextjs-app/my-nextjs-app/public/favicon.ico should contain the binary data for the favicon image. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as `favicon.ico` in the specified directory.

You can create a favicon using online tools or design software, and then place the resulting `.ico` file in the `public` directory of your Next.js application.
